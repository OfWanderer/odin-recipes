        <h2>What is Sosyete Mantısı ?</h2>
        
        <p>As some of you might have guessed there actually is not an exact translation for the name of this Turkish food.Closest you can get is to call it in english probably would be a "Society Patty".It is basically a pastry filled with minced meat, topped with yogurt and sauce on it. </p>
        <p>Now don't get scared!It does not contain any dark magic, on the contrary it's a rather simple dish to make and enjoy yourself while eating.Unless you are a vegetarian, in that case I would suggest you to go look at other variety of patties or pastries that I can offer from my homeland.</p>
        <p>Let's get to it!</p>

        <p>Before we start you might find this <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3iS8dTo2Y0">video</a></strong> visually helpful as you go trough the steps of <em>Main Dish</em> even though the spoken language is Turkish. </p>
        
        <h4>Preparation of The Topping</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Smash the amount of garlic you want in your yogurt. <em>(2-3 Cloves of Garlic Recommended)</em></li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Put the amount of yogurt you would like to have into a cup and then mix it with the smashed garlic.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Preparation of The Sauce <em>(It is recommended to prepare the sauce after you finish the main dish)</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 2 tablespoons of butter into a container or a pan that you can cook.</li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Heat up the butter until it starts melting and add mint, chili pepper into it.</li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Cook it until the butter takes a brown color, try to avoid cooking it for too much and there it is.Your sauce that will go on top of the yogurt mix should be ready.</li>
        </ol>
        
            <h4>Main Dish</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First of all we need to prepare the filling for our patty.</li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Dice the onion into thin small pieces and then cook it on a pan with sunflower oil until it gets pinky.</li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Then add the minced meat on top of it and continue to cook.</li>
            &nbsp
            <li>When the color of the mix has changed and the meat has been relatively cooked add the tomato paste, a bit of salt and other spices. </li>
            &nbsp
            <li>After it is cooked turn off the heat, add a sprinkle of chopped parsley and start mixing it. </li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Cut the phyllo doughs into equal 4 pieces. </li>
            &nbsp
            <li>After that apply a mixture of water and oil onto every each piece of phyllo dough with the help of a pastry brush and then place the fillings on afterwards.</li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Then you can roll the phyllo dough like a tube and give it shape of a rose.You can see how it is done within the video link above. </li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Again you apply the mixture of water and oil onto the rolled phyllo doughs with the help of a brush and then you put into oven which should be at 170°C without fans for about 20 minutes. </li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Without burning the top of them they should cook nicely until they get slightly pink and then taken out of the oven.</li>
            &nbsp
            <li>Put the amount of pieces or a piece that you would like to eat onto a platter and pour the mixture of yogurt and garlic on top. </li>
            &nbsp
            <li>And lastly you pour down the amount of sauce you want on top.</li>
        </ol>
