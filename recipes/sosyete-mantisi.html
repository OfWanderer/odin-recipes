        <h2>What is Sosyete Mantısı ?</h2>
        
        <p>As some of you might have guessed there actually is not an exact translation for the name of this Turkish food.Closest you can get is to call it in english probably would be a "Society Patty".It is basically a pastry filled with minced meat, topped with yogurt and sauce on it. </p>
        <p>Now don't get scared!It does not contain any black magic, on the contrary it's a rather simple dish to make and enjoy yourself while eating.Unless you are a vegetarian, in that case I would suggest you to go look at other variety of patties or pastries that I can offer from my homeland.</p>
