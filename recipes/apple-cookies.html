        <h2>Let's Make Some Apple Cookies!</h2>
            <p>As simple as they are cookies are always welcome for most people and come in different shapes, sizes or recipes.</p>
            <p>This recipe in particular I enjoy the most eating, thanks to a bit of butter and grated apple  inside it doesn't feel as dry as some other variations of cookies.</p>
            <p>If you are like me who doesn't like dry feeling cookies as much you might just want to give a try to this recipe.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Grated apple, cinnamon and sugar is taken into a pot and then cooked at middle heat until apples release and rid of their juice.</li>
                &nbsp
                <li>After that leave the mixture to cool and then you can add walnuts if you prefer.</li>
                &nbsp
                <li>Inside another cup we need to mix the dough materials except without including flour.</li>
                &nbsp
                <li>Afterwards slowly add flour as you are kneading the dough until it's soft but not sticky any longer.Try to avoid adding too much flour, otherwise your dough might end up too tough.</li>
                &nbsp
                <li>Kneaded dough then split into 5 pieces and rolled in your palms.</li>
                &nbsp
                <li>Take one of the rolled pieces onto a counter that you can work on.Flour the upper and down sides of it.After that open it to size of a dessert plate with half a cm <em>(About 1/5 inch)</em> thickness.</li>
                &nbsp
                <Li>The Opened up dough then split into 4 and each of those pieces split into 2, so you should have 8 triangular like pieces in total.</Li>
                &nbsp
                <li>After that you should apply the cooled apple mixture onto those pieces' wide parts and roll it like a cigar.</li>
                &nbsp
                <li>Shaped cookies then put onto an oven tray that has a baking paper layed down on it. </li>
                &nbsp
                <li>Cookies are then put into oven that was already heated at 170°C <em>(338°F)</em> and cooked about 20 minutes. </li>
                &nbsp
                <li>When the bottom of the cookies are slightly blushed then they are taken out.</li>
                &nbsp
                <li>Once the cookies are warmed then sugar powder is sprinkled upon them and they are read to serve.Enjoy! </li>
