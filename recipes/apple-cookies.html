        <h2>Let's Make Some Apple Cookies!</h2>
            <p>As simple as they are cookies are always welcome for most people and come in different shapes, sizes or recipes.</p>
            <p>This recipe in particular I enjoy the most eating, thanks to a bit of butter and grated apple  inside it doesn't feel as dry as some other variations of cookies.</p>
            <p>If you are like me who doesn't like dry feeling cookies as much you might just want to give a try to this recipe.</p>
